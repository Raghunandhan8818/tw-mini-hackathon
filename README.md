# Thoughtworks RideShare
As part of the Back-To-Office initiative, Thoughtworks aims to see more people travel to office regularly. 
To enable people travel economically and efficiently, we propose a Rideshare app which allows users to sign up and plan their carpooling routes efficiently. 
As community is at the core of Thoughtworks' principles, this helps us build one and also ensures that we do our tiny bit to ease traffic congestion and pollution.


## Solution
Any Thoughtworker can sign up with their location and which days they plan to go to office, and we map the non-address specific route of other Thoughtworkers along the optimal path.
This is to ensure that no personal data if revealed without consent. Once the user, chooses a specific route, they can reach out to that Thoughtworker for further details and planning.
